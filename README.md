## Project Overview

### Description
This project is a Django web application designed for a community development organization, managing users, contributions, etc.. It provides functionalities for user registration, login, and management of user-related data.

### Goals
- Provide a user-friendly interface for managing user accounts.
- Ensure secure authentication and authorization.
- Allow users to manage their profiles and contributions easily.

## Technologies Used
- **Django**: Web framework used for building the application.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/myusername/myproject.git
   cd myproject

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**:

   *python -m venv venv*
   *source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`*

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   *pip install -r requirements.txt*

4. **Run Migrations**:
   *python manage.py migrate*


5. **Create a Superuser (optional)**:
   *python manage.py createsuperuser*

## Features:
- **User Registration**: Users can create accounts.

- **User Login**: Users can log in to their accounts.

- **Profile Management**: Users can update their profile information.

- **Password Reset**: Users can reset their passwords.

### Responsive Design: The application is mobile-friendly.


## Usage:
**Register a New User**: Navigate to the registration page, fill in the required details, and submit the form.

**Login**: Use your credentials to log in to the application.

**Manage Profile**: Once logged in, navigate to your profile to update information.

## Testing:
**Testing Framework**
I use Django's built-in testing framework for unit tests.

### Running Tests
To run the tests, use the following command:
    ---bash---
*python manage.py test*

### Writing Tests:
Tests are located in the tests.py file within each application directory. Here’s an example of a simple test case:

**python**

*Run*:

from django.test import TestCase
from django.urls import reverse

class UserRegistrationTests(TestCase):
    def test_registration_page(self):
        response = self.client.get(reverse('register'))
        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 200)
        self.assertTemplateUsed(response, 'baduma_youths/register.html')

### Test Coverage:
Consider using a coverage tool to check how much of your code is tested:
   ---bash---
**pip install coverage**
*coverage run manage.py test*
coverage report

## Future Improvements:
below are my future suggestions to make the project more inclusive and user_friendly

1.Implement email verification for new registrations.
2.Add social media login options (e.g., Google, Facebook).
3.Enhance the user profile with additional fields and features.
4.Improve testing coverage and add integration tests.
